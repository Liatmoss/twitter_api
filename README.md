# Tweeting App

When this application is run, the Raspberry Pi will tweet when motion is detected from the PIR Sensor

## Setting up
This project has been coded on a Raspberry Pi ZeroW with a motion sensor, camera and Twitter API.

The motion sensor is located on GPIO 4. If you change the pin the motion sensor is connected to make sure it is changed in the code as well on line 11.

## Twitter API
This project uses the Twitter API. Follow instruction from Raspberry Pi on [getting started with the Twitter API](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api)
